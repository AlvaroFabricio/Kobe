## Kobe
How did Kobe Score?
We are doing a Supervised Machine Learning for this project

Our team is interested to analyze Kobe Bryantâ€™s performance as he is one of the most valuable players in NBA. 
Specifically, we take a look at all his shots from 1996 to 2016. 
Our original dataset has 25 columns including information about shot types, ranges, game time and so on. 
After data cleaning, we run several models on 94 columns and caculate MSEs to determine the best fit.
We use Dataset Kobe (https://www.kaggle.com/c/kobe-bryant-shot-selection/data)
  
We are hoping this project would be helpful for basketball players who want to learn from Kobe Bryant and even for analysis of other sports.
